GENETICS
========

Replication
-----------

Copy over winner
Clone (25% of previous genomes skewed by fitness)
Crossover: 75% from picking 2 random genes using fitness skew
Mutation: 0.1% change of bit flip

Mutation
--------

Weight Mutation: 80% change to mutate
    - 90% chanee to mutate in a gaussian around the value
    - 10% chance to mutate randomly
Structural Muration
    - 5% chance to add a new gene (add a connection between two existing nodes)
    - 3% chance to add a new node (disable connection, create new node, with connection of weight 1 for the 1st connection, and prexisting weight for the 2nd)
