# Nurltown: an machine learning powered ecosystem simulator
The happy, sunshiney little village of Nurltown, where virtual creatures (nurlets) run around, have outdoor potlucks,
and **fight to the death.**

## Objectives
* Design a 2D game engine to run the simulation
* Develop neural networks to give your nurlet a brain (itâ€™s ALIIIIIVE!!)
* Implement evolutionary algorithms to teach your nurlets how to eat, grow, multiply, and defend against their enemies

## Core Components
* Python 3.x
* PyGame module for visualization
* Our custom NEAT implementation
